Hi, I'm Hiya! I grew up in India, but am now a NYC local, studying neuroscience at Fordham.

I care deeply about the intersection of technology and mental health, and I'm passionate about using technology to help people. I'm currently working on a project called [Mental Health Hackathon](https://www.mentalhealthhackathon.com/), which aims to bring together students from all over the world to create mental health solutions. I'm also a member of the {" "} [Fordham Psychology Research Lab](https://www.fordham.edu/academics/colleges-and-schools/college-of-arts-and-sciences/department-of-psychology/undergraduate-program/undergraduate-research-opportunities/undergraduate-research-opportunities.aspx), where I'm working on a project that aims to use machine learning to predict the onset of depression in college students.

In the past, I spent a semester at [SciencesPo Reims](https://www.sciencespo.fr/en/), where I studied economics and policy. I was also in San Francisco working at [Transcend Network](https://www.transcend-network.com/), a network for people trying to build something new in the world of education.
